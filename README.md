# **Aero-plane takeoff and landing**

**With changes in the background**

- **The idea of the project was to draw a plane that moves along the screen.**
- **It can be named as BANGABONDHU AIRWAYS for display purpose on the screen.**

# **System features and implementations**

- **Front Page with human interaction.**
- **Environment changes.**
- **Take off for the plane from the runway.**
- **The movement of the plane from left to right of the screen.**
- **The background environment changes describing how night falls gradually from evening.**
- **The actual way of flying .**

**These things occurs in a continuous one by one window changes.**

# **How the implementation was done**

- **The base window size 1920 x 1080 pixels per unit**
- **One by one function declaration like Airpor1, Airport2, AIUB, City, hills, Cox&#39;s bazar etc.**
- **Calculation for translating &amp; geometrical shapes.**
- **OpenGL graphics library in the code blocks IDE**
- **Basically glvertex3f was used to make the graphical and geometrical shapes of all the Object.**
- **glutKeyboarFunc was used to make the human interaction on the scenario.**
- **glColor3f, glColor3ub was used for adding and varying the colors in the scenarios.**
